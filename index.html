            We are a collaborative organization for women who make things. Our goal is to get women more involved
            in the makerâ€™s movement and to create an environment where women can come together to share their ideals,
            goals, and projects. A maker is anyone who engages in creative work professionally or personally; we welcome
            any women who consider themselves makers, as well as the people who support them.
          </p>
          <p>
            We strive to create a space that is predominantly women so that our voices can be heard. This includes holding a
            range of events such as social gatherings, panel discussions, and workshops for members to learn new skills.
            We consciously focus on incorporating women makers into the already established maker community and showing the
            value of our work.
          </p>

          <p>Our next meetup will be a studio tour with local maker Laura Sissoko on September 22, 2016 at Atlantic Fine Woods. <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Society-of-Lady-Makers-Atlanta/events/233981438/"> You can RSVP for the event through Meetup.</a>

            The Society of Lady Makers has teamed up with Atlanta Maker Faire to create the Society of Lady Maker's Marketplace at Atlanta Maker Faire, October 1st and 2nd. As part of Atlanta Maker Faire, we will be holding a curated marketplace for a curated group of women makers, vendors, and women owned businesses.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is a curated marketplace as part of Atlanta Maker Faire. All businesses participating in Atlanta Maker Faire that are woman owned or have a mostly female presence are eligbible to apply for the marketplace. Prices for vendors are $100 for a 6' by 3' table, and $60 for a 3' by 3' table*. A tent and electricity will be provided for vendors by Atlanta Maker Faire.
          </p>

          <p>
